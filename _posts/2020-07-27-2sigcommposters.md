Two posters accepted at ACM SIGCOMM 2020!!! In **Revisiting Heavy-Hitters: Don't count packets, compute flow inter-packet metrics in the data plane** 
we explore the possibility to detect heavy flows in the data plane by keeping track of the per-flow Inter Packet Gap (IPG) metric instead of flow counters.
In **Automatic Optimization of Software Data Planes** instead, we make a case for a compiler that continuously optimizes software data planes at 
run-time. Furthermore, we propose its architecture and discuss the challenges associated with its design.
