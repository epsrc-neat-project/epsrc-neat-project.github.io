With **DISCOvering the Heavy Hitters with Disaggregated Sketches**, we propose an approach to flow monitoring that use fewer resources at switches than state-of-the-art solutions while increasing the heavy flows detection accuracy. This is achieved by disaggregating the computation of a (logically) centralized single big sketch into multiple small-sketches distributed across the flows' paths.
