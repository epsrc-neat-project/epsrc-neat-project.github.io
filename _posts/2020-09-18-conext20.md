In **Detecting Routing Loops in the Data Plane** we present Unroller, a solution that enables 
real-time identification of routing loops in the data plane with minimal overheads. The idea is  
to encode a varying fixed-size subset of the traversed path on each packet.  

The work is a collaboration between Queen Mary University of London, CESNET and Harvard University.
